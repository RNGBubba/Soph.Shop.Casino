## **Detailed Code Breakdown**
### **Peripheral Setup**
This ensures all peripherals are correctly connected:
```lua
leftMonitor = peripheral.wrap("left")
topMonitor = peripheral.wrap("top")
diskDrive = peripheral.wrap("right")
inputChest = peripheral.wrap("minecraft:chest_2")
outputChest = peripheral.wrap("minecraft:chest_3")
storageController = peripheral.wrap("sophisticatedstorage:controller_0")
```

### **Key Functions**
#### Item-to-Credit Conversion
Handles converting deposited items into credits:
```lua
function convertItemsToCredits()
    local items = inputChest.list()
    for slot, item in pairs(items) do
        local price = itemPrices[item.name]
        if price then
            local credits = price * item.count
            addCreditsToPlayer(credits)
            inputChest.remove(slot, item.count)
        end
    end
end
```

#### Adding Credits
Adds credits to the playerâ€™s balance:
```lua
function addCreditsToPlayer(amount)
    local playerData = readPlayerData()
    playerData.balance = playerData.balance + amount
    writePlayerData(playerData)
end
```

#### Purchasing Items
Handles item purchases:
```lua
function purchaseItem(itemName, quantity)
    local cost = itemPrices[itemName] * quantity
    local playerData = readPlayerData()
    if playerData.balance >= cost then
        if storageController.pullItems("outputChest", itemName, quantity) then
            playerData.balance = playerData.balance - cost
            writePlayerData(playerData)
        else
            print("Not enough items in stock.")
        end
    else
        print("Insufficient credits.")
    end
end
```

#### Casino Slot Machine
Simulates the slot machine game:
```lua
function playSlotMachine()
    local result = math.random(1, 100)
    if result <= 5 then
        awardJackpot()
    elseif result <= 20 then
        awardSmallPrize()
    else
        deductCredits(10)
    end
end
```

#### File I/O for Persistence
Reads and writes player data to the disk:
```lua
function readPlayerData()
    local file = fs.open("disk/playerData", "r")
    local data = textutils.unserialize(file.readAll())
    file.close()
    return data or { balance = 0 }
end

function writePlayerData(data)
    local file = fs.open("disk/playerData", "w")
    file.write(textutils.serialize(data))
    file.close()
end
```
